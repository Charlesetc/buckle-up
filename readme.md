# Buckle up!

This is an example repository for getting started with reason and bucklescript. It compiles reason to js with modules and then uses r.js to be able to work in-browser.

To get started:

```
git clone git@github.com:Charlesetc/buckle-up.git
npm install
make serve
```

If you see any issues, let me know!
